Revision history for Authen-Passphrase-SaltedSHA512
0.05    00:08 PDT Saturday Sep 15, 2012
    - Switched random number back-end to Bytes::Random::Secure (which
      essentially uses the same dependencies anyway, but abstracts away the
      details, and could switch easily to another generator in the future).
    - Explanation in the POD as to why dependencies are heavy.

    - Added Statistics::Test::RandomWalk to BUILD_REQUIRES
      because Math::Random::Secure fails to list it as a 
      dependency for its test suite.  If that bug gets fixed,
      we can remove it from our Makefile.PL.
      See Math::Random::Secure RT#74541.
