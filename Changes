Revision history for Perl module Authen::Passphrase::SaltedSHA512

0.07 2013-03-05
  - Update PDO to reflect shift from Math::Random::Secure to
    Bytes::Random::Secure.
  - Optimized away two minor conditional branches (which improved
    test coverage).

0.06 2012-11-02
  - "Changes" is now CPAN::Changes::Spec compliant.
  - Added t/09-changes.t to verify compliance with the spec.

0.05 2012-09-15
  - Switched random number back-end to Bytes::Random::Secure (which
    essentially uses the same dependencies anyway, but abstracts away the
    details, and could switch easily to another generator in the future).
  - Explanation in the POD as to why dependencies are heavy.

0.04 2012-09-06
  - Added Statistics::Test::RandomWalk to BUILD_REQUIRES
    because Math::Random::Secure fails to list it as a 
    dependency for its test suite.  If that bug gets fixed,
    we can remove it from our Makefile.PL.
    See Math::Random::Secure RT#74541.

0.03 2012-05-31
  - Improved instantiation of SUPER-class.

0.02 2012-05-28

  - POD Acknowledements section added.
  - Additional metadata added to Makefile.PL.
  - ./examples directory added with several example scripts.

0.01 2012-05-26
